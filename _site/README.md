About this project
=======

My graphic design apprenticeship was coming to an end and with that the final exam was right around the corner. I created this small site as part of my preperation. It basically is just a long list of usefull links about the different exam topics. Be it a blog post, a handwritten fact sheet, a good book recommendation or just a wikipedia article. I got pretty much every topic covered with a few helpfull links.
